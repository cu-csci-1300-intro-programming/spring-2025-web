\begin{enumerate}
    1. Learn the differences between header and source files
    1. Compile multiple files and organizing code across multiple files
    1. Learn how to nest objects

\end{enumerate}
    
\end{abstract}

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
## Background
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
### Header and Source Files
Creating our own classes with various data members and functions increases the complexity of our program. Putting all of the code for our classes as well as the main functionality of our program into one .cpp file can become confusing for you as a programmer, and we need ways of reducing the visual clutter that this creates. This is why, as we increase the complexity of a program, we might need to create multiple files: header and source files, which capture the *definition* and *implementation* of the class, respectively.

&nbsp;&nbsp;
#### Header Files

Header files have .h as their filename extensions. In a header file, we declare one or more of the complex structures (classes) we want to develop. In a class, we define member functions and member attributes. These functions and attributes are the building blocks of the class.

\begin{example}
    Example File 0: ClassName.h
    {% highlight c++ %}
#include <iostream> 
using namespace std; 
class ClassName 
{ 
    public: 
    . 
    . 
    . 
    private: 
    . 
    . 
    . 
};

    {% endhighlight %}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    Example File 1: IntelligenceAgency.h
    {% highlight c++ %}
#include <iostream> 
using namespace std; 
class IntelligenceAgency
{
    public:
        IntelligenceAgency();         // Default constructor
        IntelligenceAgency(string classifiedIntelligenceInput); // Parameterized const
        string organization_name;
        string getClassifiedIntelligence(){return classifiedIntelligence};
        void setClassifiedIntelligence(string classifiedIntelligenceInput)
        {classifiedIntelligence=classifiedIntelligenceInput};

    private:
        string classified_intelligence;
};
    {% endhighlight %}
\end{example}

&nbsp;&nbsp;
#### Source File

Source files are recognizable by the .cpp extension. In a source file, we implement the class defined in the header file. Since we are splitting the development of actual code for the class into a definition (header file) and an implementation (source file), we need to link the two somehow.

{% highlight c++ %}
//IntelligenceAgency Example
#include "IntelligenceAgency.h"
{% endhighlight %}

Or, more generally,

{% highlight c++ %}
//General Example
#include "ClassName.h"
{% endhighlight %}

In the source file, we will include the header file that defines the class so that the source file is “aware” of where we can retrieve the definition of the class. We must define the class definition in every source that wants to use our user defined data type (our class). When implementing each member function, our source files must tell the compiler that these functions are actually the methods defined in our class definition using the syntax that we showed earlier.

&nbsp;&nbsp;
#### How To Compile Multiple Files

Once you create a project with one or more separate classes, it will be necessary to write multiple files (.h and .cpp) and test them before submitting them. You need to compile and execute your code using the command line. Make sure that you start by changing directories so that you are in the folder where your solution’s files are stored. In this example, our folder will be called **project2**. To change to this directory, use:

\mintinline{bash}{cd project2/}

When compiling from the command line, you need to specify every `.cpp` file in your project. This means that when you call the g++ compiler, you need to explicitly name the files you’re compiling:

\mintinline{bash}{g++ -std=c++17 file1.cpp file2.cpp main.cpp}

The compiling command results in the creation of an executable file. Note that header files (.h) are NOT included in compilation commands. If you did not specify a name for this executable, it will be named `a.out` by default. To execute this file, use the command:

\mintinline{bash}{./a.out}

You can add the \mintinline{bash}{-o} flag to your compiling command to give the output file a name:

\mintinline{bash}{g++ -o myName.out -std=c++17 file1.cpp file2.cpp main.cpp}

And then run it with:

\mintinline{bash}{./myName.out}

At this stage, you may also find it helpful to begin compiling with flags that tell you more information about possible errors in your code. These flags include:

\mintinline{bash}{-Wall}

Wall is short for "Warn All", which will turn on most of the warnings in C++. This will help identify various possible ways your code might go wrong, including array bounds errors and other helpful messages.

\mintinline{bash}{-Werror}

Werror will treat all warnings as errors. This will prevent you from skipping past the possible sources of error in your code, and you will need to make sure all warnings are resolved prior to compiling.

\mintinline{bash}{-Wpedantic}

This flag enables warnings that alert you about language constructs that are not ISO C or ISO C++ standard compliant. This is particularly helpful to identify constructs that may not be uniform in other compilers, which could cause problems with your code on other machines. This will help prevent instances where your code works on your personal computer, but does not work on CodeRunner or on the grader's computer. All together, your command line prompt will look something like this:

\mintinline{bash}{g++ -Wall -Werror -Wpedantic -o myName.out -std=c++17 file1.cpp file2.cpp main.cpp}

%maybe add a section on header guards? 
%add a section on arrays in objects?

\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
True or False: In a class, public members are only accessible by member functions within the same class.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
True or False: Structs in C++ can only contain public data members, while classes can have both public and private data members.

};

int main() {
    ____ myLocation{"____", ____};  // Initialize with name and population

    cout << "Location: " << myLocation.____ << endl;
    cout << "Population: " << myLocation.____ << endl;

    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

    }
    
    void ____ (int a) {  // Setter method for age
        age = ____;
    }
    
    int ____() const {  // Getter method for age
        return ____;
    }

private:
    int ____;  // Private data member to store age
};

int main() {
    ____ person(25);  // Create a Person object with age 25
    person.____(30);  // Set the person's age to 30
    cout << "The person's age is: " << person.____() << endl;  // Get and display the age
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Coffee Shop Order System
This exercise focuses on using structs and basic arrays in C++ to create a simple coffee shop ordering system. You will define structs to represent drinks and orders, as well as functions to manage and calculate the order's total.

To begin, define a struct called <tt>Drink</tt>. The <tt>Drink</tt> struct should have three fields: a <tt>string</tt> <tt>name</tt> for the drink’s name (e.g., "Latte" or "Espresso"), a <tt>string</tt> <tt>size</tt> for the drink’s size ("small," "medium," or "large"), and a <tt>double</tt> <tt>price</tt> for the drink’s cost. Next, create a function called <tt>displayDrink</tt> that takes a <tt>Drink</tt> object as an argument and outputs its details in a readable format such as:

\begin{quote}
<tt>[Size] [Name]: \$[Price]</tt>
\end{quote}

For example, a medium latte priced at \$3.50 should display as <tt>Medium Latte: \$3.50</tt>.

Now, create a second struct called <tt>Order</tt> to represent a customer’s order. The <tt>Order</tt> struct should contain an array of <tt>Drink</tt> objects and an integer <tt>numDrinks</tt> that tracks the number of drinks in the order. To keep things simple, assume a maximum of 10 drinks per order. Define <tt>numDrinks</tt> with an initial value of 0.

Next, write a function called <tt>addDrink</tt> that takes an <tt>Order</tt> and a <tt>Drink</tt> as arguments, adds the drink to the order’s <tt>drinks</tt> array, and increments <tt>numDrinks</tt>. If the order already has 10 drinks, output an error message and prevent additional drinks from being added.

Now create a function called <tt>calculateTotal</tt> that takes an <tt>Order</tt> as a parameter and returns the total price of all drinks in the order by summing the <tt>price</tt> of each <tt>Drink</tt> in the <tt>drinks</tt> array. Finally, implement a function called <tt>displayOrder</tt> that prints out each drink in the order using <tt>displayDrink</tt> and then displays the total order cost.

In the <tt>main</tt> function, test your structs and functions by creating a few <tt>Drink</tt> objects, an <tt>Order</tt> object, and adding the drinks to the order. Finally, call <tt>displayOrder</tt> to print the details of the order and verify that the total is calculated correctly.

\begin{multipart}
    Write out the steps you would use to solve this problem by hand as pseudocode.
\end{multipart}

\vspace{8cm}

\begin{multipart}
    Write three possible lines you can include in your file to later test your program. Try to pick values that will test different aspects of your program. Follow the steps you wrote for these values to find your result, and verify it.
\end{multipart}

\vspace{5cm}

\begin{multipart}
    Implement your solution in C++ using VS Code. Save, compile, and run it. Test the program with different input files, including boundary conditions.
\end{multipart}

## Homework 8
%all object content is fair game here. Make sure to have 1 question with an array of objects

**Warning: You are not allowed to use global variables for this assignment.**

All function names, return types, and parameters must precisely match those shown. You may not use pass by reference or otherwise modify the function prototypes. You are welcome to create additional functions that may help streamline your code. 

**Note:** Questions 1 through 3 are grouped together as Part I, and Questions 4 through 6 are grouped together as Part II.

In Part I, you'll develop a basic Library System by creating a Library class to manage a collection of books. In Part II, you'll develop a Quest Style Game. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
### Library Class 


Create a class Library by splitting the code into the following files:

    1. A header file `Library.h` to declare the definition of the class
    1.  An implementation file `Library.cpp` to implement the class defined in the header
    1.  A driver file `LibraryDriver.cpp` that contains the main function


**For Question 1, develop and validate your solution in VS Code. Once you are happy with your solution, go to coderunner and paste `Library.h` and `Library.cpp` files into the answer box. (Note: You are not expected to complete the implementation of `getAveragePageCount()` function for Q1, but do include the function declaration within the header file).**

- All libraries[] array will be non-empty. \\ \hline

**Example:** & 

\begin{example}

{% highlight c++ %}

// Assume the proper libraries are included
// Assume the proper implementation of the Library class is included

int main() {
    const int ARR_SIZE = 2;
    int page_counts1[3] = {250, 300, 350};
    int page_counts2[4] = {200, 300, 250, 400};
    Library library1 = Library("Downtown Library", page_counts1, 3);
    Library library2 = Library("Uptown Library", page_counts2, 4);
    Library libraries[ARR_SIZE] = {library1, library2};

}

{% endhighlight %}
\end{example}


**Expected Output:** 

\vspace{5pt}
<tt>Downtown Library</tt> 
\vspace{5pt}

**Explanation:** 

\vspace{5pt}
Average page count of `library1` = 300.00 \newline
Average page count of `library2` = 287.50 \newline

`library1` has the largest average page count, so we return the name of `library1`, i.e., `Downtown Library`.

### Game Class 

Create a class Game by splitting the code into the following files:


    1. A header file `Game.h` to declare the definition of the class
    1.  An implementation file `Game.cpp` to implement the class defined in the header
    1.  A driver file `GameDriver.cpp` that contains the main function to test the class


**For Question 5, develop and validate your solution in VS Code. Once you are happy with your solution, go to coderunner on Canvas and paste `Game.h`, `Game.cpp`, `Character.h`, and `Character.cpp` into the answer box.**

### Loading Characters

To begin the game, load characters from text files to populate the player and creature lists.

Create a players.txt file with the following content:

\begin{verbatim}
name|health|mana|status
Brian|100|50|A
Jenna|80|100|F
\end{verbatim}


Create a creatures.txt file with the following content:

\begin{verbatim}
name|health|mana|status
Goblin|100|50|A
Frog|80|100|A
\end{verbatim}

Note: All files used in this problem are in a zipped folder titled <tt>'homework\_8\_input\_files.zip'</tt> located in Canvas under the week 11 module. \newline

Write a function `loadCharacters()` that reads data from a text file and fills an array of Character objects. The text file contains information about different characters, with each character's information separated by the character | and each character listed on a new line. The function specification is provided below. \newline



**For Question 6, develop and validate your solution in VS Code. Once you are happy with your solution, go to coderunner on Canvas and paste `Character.h`, `Character.cpp`, `Game.h`, `Game.cpp`, and `loadCharacters` function into the answer box.**

**Function:** `loadCharacters(string,` \newline `Character[], const int,` \newline `bool)` & `bool loadCharacters(string filename, Character characters[],` \newline `const int CHARACTERS_SIZE, bool is_creature)` \\ \hline

**Purpose:** & Reads data from the specified text file and fills the <tt>characters</tt> array with <tt>Character</tt> objects. Sets `_isCreature` based on the <tt>is\_creature</tt> parameter. \\ \hline

**Parameters:** & 
**string** <tt>filename</tt> - Name of the text file to be read. \newline
**Character** <tt>characters[]</tt> - Array of <tt>Character</tt> objects to be filled. \newline
**const int** <tt>CHARACTERS\_SIZE</tt> - The maximum size of the <tt>characters</tt> array. \newline
**bool** <tt>is\_creature</tt> - Specifies if each character read from the file is a creature. \\ \hline

**Return Value:** & <tt>bool</tt> : Returns <tt>true</tt> if characters were successfully read and stored in the array; <tt>false</tt> if the file cannot be opened. \\ \hline

**Error Handling:** & 
- Returns <tt>false</tt> if the file cannot be opened. \newline
- Ignores any empty lines in the file. \newline
- The first line of the file is ignored as it contains headers. \\ \hline
