Welcome to the CSCI 1300 workbook. The about page is still under construction.
The short version is that through study of learning sciences and collaboration with
the [Center for Teaching and Learning](https://www.colorado.edu/center/teaching-learning/),
we offer this webpage as a one stop shop for all of the material of the course. 
We are actively working to provide a downloadable offline version of the document while continuing
to maintain and expand the existing material.
